  <h1>Products</h1>
  <p>An object-oriented programming language. In Object-Oriented Programming
methodology, a program consists of various objects that interact with each other by
means of actions. The actions that an object may take are called methods. Objects
of the same kind are said to have the same type or are said to be in the same class.
For example, let us consider a Rectangle object. It has attributes such as length and
width. Depending upon the design, it may need ways for accepting the values of
these attributes, calculating the area, and displaying details.
